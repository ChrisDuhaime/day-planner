# Summary of Project
On this assignment we were given an index.html page and a style.css sheet as starter code.  I was able to utilize the existing classes within the style.css to help stucture my Website and Javascript.  I utilized the API's that were already linked in my HTML like Bootstrap, Jquery, FontAwesome, and Moment to get the date and time. 

In my JS I have a startScheduler() function  to get any localStorage saved and display to textArea.  I added EventHandler click function to save the text inputs to localStorage.  I added function setDivColor(currentTime, parentDivClass) to adjust the colors.  The classes were already in CSS just had to utilize them in the JS.
